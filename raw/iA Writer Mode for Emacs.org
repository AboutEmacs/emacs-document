Before switching back to Linux, I had used [[https://ia.net/writer][iA writer]] quite often in my Macbook Air. It's an excellent product that does one thing: helping you focus on what you think. I enjoyed it a lot, although it'd save my documents to iCloud (or Dropbox), and it doesn't work in Linux.

In Linux, Emacs is my home for writing. I put all my notes in two Git repositories; one private, and one [[https://github.com/azer/notebook][public notebook]]. Anything important that I can't remember is a Markdown file. It's like my mind's hard drive.

Recently, I wanted to change my Emacs configuration just for Markdown files, so I can have similar experience with iA Writer. Here is the outline of the changes that got Emacs to look like it was born to be an iA Writer competitor:

- Define a mode-hook for =markdown-mode=, so our changes will only apply to markdown documents.
- Use different font family and size in markdown-mode.
- Center the content
- Turn off line numbers
- Increase line-spacing

Let's look at these changes individually;

* writing-mode
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: writing-mode
  :END:

We'll define a function that will be triggered whenever we want to enable it. Here is an empty function and a hook for =markdown-mode=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun writing-mode ())
    (add-hook 'markdown-mode-hook 'writing-mode)
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Custom Fonts
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: custom-fonts
  :END:

It makes more sense to use different font family and font size for taking notes. We can use the same font with iA Writer as they [[https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts][open sourced their font]].

Personally, I preferred a simple "Sans" font that existed in my system. If you're a Linux user, you can list the available fonts by running:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ fc-list : family
#+END_EXAMPLE

Once you selected the font, you can set custom font family and size like in the following example:"

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun writing-mode ()
     (interactive)
     (setq buffer-face-mode-face '(:family "dejavu sans mono" :height 150))
     (buffer-face-mode))
#+END_EXAMPLE

You might probably want to check if your changes was applied. Open a random Markdown document, enable =writing-mode= and run =describe-char= command to see what font is being used in the document.

* Centering
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: centering
  :END:

I tried various modes that allows centering the content, [[https://github.com/joostkremers/writeroom-mode][writing-room mode]] worked best. We'll just enable it whenever =writing-mode= is called:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun writing-mode ()
     (interactive)
     (setq buffer-face-mode-face '(:family "dejavu sans mono" :height 150))
     (buffer-face-mode)
     (writeroom-mode 1))
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Final Version
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: final-version
  :END:

On top of these general changes, I made some personal additions such as turning off line numbers, making cursor blink, etc.

Below is the final version that I came up with. ([[https://github.com/azer/spacemacs-files/blob/master/writing-mode/funcs.el#L3][Github Copy]]):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun writing-mode ()
     (interactive)
     (setq buffer-face-mode-face '(:family "dejavu sans mono" :height 150))
     (buffer-face-mode)
     (linum-mode 0)
     (writeroom-mode 1)
     (blink-cursor-mode)
     (visual-line-mode 1)
     (setq truncate-lines nil)
     (setq-default line-spacing 5)
     (setq global-hl-line-mode nil)
     )
#+END_EXAMPLE

Optionally, you can tell Emacs to use =markdown-mode= in =*scratch*= to bring up the writing mode easily:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setq initial-major-mode 'markdown-mode)
#+END_EXAMPLE

That's all. Feel free to share your recommendations with me by [[mailto:azer@roadbeats.com][e-mail]].
