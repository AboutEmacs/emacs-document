This is a short post pulling in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/73vwpa/stumpwm_light_colors_with_purple_accent/dnvqwt8/?context=1][my comment]] on a /r/unixporn submission where I
document my Org mode dotfiles for a word processor like interface. The aim is to
recreate a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/6lj3h3/stumpwmkde_emacs_org_mode_writing_setup/][rice]] I submitted on /r/unixporn some time back. Shown below is a demo
of what the thing actually looks like.

Following screencast shows the setup in action.

[[https://lepisma.github.io/2017/10/28/ricing-org-mode/demo.png]]

The look is inspired from the style used by [[https://edwardtufte.github.io/et-book][Edward Tufte]] in his books. A
replication of the style in CSS is up on github for free at [[https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/][tufte-css]]. Other
than the proper spacing and margins, the thing that I like in Tufte's style is
the font [[https://edwardtufte.github.io/et-book][ET Book]] which is an old-style serif font with beautiful /italics/.

Et Book font

To start, we need a nice looking light color scheme so that faces other than
that of Org mode look decent. I selected [[https://github.com/nashamri/spacemacs-theme][spacemacs-light]] mostly because I use
spacemacs and it is pretty complete as far as number of faces covered is
concerned. Also, it has a good off-white background (=#fbf8ef=). There are three
basic steps involved from here:

- Setting faces and themes
- Padding and stuff
- Other Org-mode visual and usability tweaks

** 1 Faces

We will set Et Book (named =EtBembo=) font to most of the org mode. Get the font
[[https://github.com/edwardtufte/et-book][here]]. If you are using spacemacs, the easy way is to use the =theming= layer in
spacemacs to set faces. My face config are available [[https://github.com/lepisma/rogue/blob/75ab1c3422b409f41daa4c003b931e869eed0914/config.el#L205][here]]. For each face, the
second set of properties are for the light theme (spacemacs-light). I have set
the =variable-pitch= font to be =EtBembo= (along with title and stuff) and enable
=variable-pitch-mode= when in an org buffer.

Note that unlike other face settings, =org-indent='s =(:inherit (org-hide fixed-pitch))= has a crucial effect of aligning text under Org heading in a
non-monospace font, so you might not want to miss that.

** 2 Padding

There are a few places where you can gain some breathing space.

- /Line spacing/

  Per buffer line spacing can be set using the variable =line-spacing=. Something
  like 0.1 goes well here.

- /Top padding/

  Similar to =mode-line=, Emacs also has =header-line= for windows. Setting its
  format to empty string =(setq header-line-format " ")= gives you top padding.
  Also by changing header-line face height, you can change this spacing.

- /Side padding/

  Adding side spaces is possible by setting margin width. You also need to reset
  the buffer to make the change visible. Here is a function that does that:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      (lambda () (progn
       (setq left-margin-width 2)
       (setq right-margin-width 2)
       (set-window-buffer nil (current-buffer))))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

If you need padding all around the frame so that everything (including
mode-line) goes inside the padded view, you can set =internal-border-width=.

You can also try [[https://github.com/joostkremers/writeroom-mode][writeroom-mode]] which makes the writing buffer cleaner and has
settings for many of the padding related stuff. One neat feature is that it
makes the buffer text centered and hides mode line. I don't use it much since my
current settings reproduce pretty much what I need from it. Nevertheless, [[https://github.com/lepisma/rogue/blob/75ab1c3422b409f41daa4c003b931e869eed0914/packages.el#L264-L287][here
is some config]] for writeroom.

** 3 Other tweaks

Whatever information your mode line might be displaying, most likely it can be
turned off if you are aiming for a distraction free setup. Spacemacs provide a
minor mode =hidden-mode-line-mode= to hide the mode line, which can be added to
your org hook. Some other minor settings follow:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setq org-startup-indented t
     org-bullets-bullet-list '(" ") 
     org-ellipsis "  " 
     org-pretty-entities t
     org-hide-emphasis-markers t
     
     org-agenda-block-separator ""
     org-fontify-whole-heading-line t
     org-fontify-done-headline t
     org-fontify-quote-and-verse-blocks t)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Also try disabling =hl-line-mode= in org-mode as varying line heights make these
highlights look bad. Install [[https://github.com/Fuco1/org-pretty-table][org-pretty-table-mode]] for getting beautiful table
borders. Other stuff like latex (=org-latex-toggle-fragment=) and image previews
(=org-image-toggle-inline=) come bundled in with org.
