I have started using Spacemacs with Evil Mode recently in order to get started with org-mode. There are no concise guides to get one started with Spacemacs in Evil-mode quickly. Hence I collated this guide to get going with basic text editing functions within 15-20 mins.

* But first...
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: but-first
    :END:

- If you want to know the Spacemacs installation steps, [[https://simpletutorials.com/c/2758/How+to+Install+Spacemacs+on+Windows][then this post]] details it nicely.
- The anchor key in Spacemacs is the =SPACE= bar. Most of the commands start with the =SPACE=. This key will be abbreviated as =SPC=.
- Once the Command mode is started press =ESC= to get out of it. Command mode cursor is a block cursor, while the edit mode cursor is a line cursor. This should make it easy to figure out which mode is the editor in.
- The commands or key sequence specified is *case sensitive*.
- Just pressing the =SPC= key will list the command options available.
- If any wrong combo has been pressed, press =ESC= to return to default command mode state. Also the commands that start with =ESC=, can be entered without the =ESC= if the editor is already in command mode.

* Vi commands quick overview
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: vi-commands-quick-overview
    :END:

- Enter edit/insert mode in opened file -- =i=
- Save file -- =ESC :w=
- Save and close file -- =ESC :wq=
- Close file without saving -- =ESC :q!=

* Open Existing File
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: open-existing-file
    :END:

- Open find file window in root directory or current working directory -- =SPC f f=
- Auto-complete works by entering few character and pressing =TAB=
- To move up in the directory hierarchy -- =Ctrl - h=
- To switch between drives, enter drive name like this -- =e:/=

  - The same can be used to move directly to the root of the current drive, by just typing in the drive name as specified above.

* Open, Save & Close ‘New File'
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: open-save-close-new-file
    :END:

- Open file works the same as the ‘Open Existing file' steps, just with the addition of the file name being added. If the file does not exist, it will be created.
- Saving contents works with the vi shortcut as well as with the Spacemacs command -- =SPC f s=
- The ‘/Save as/‘ command maps to the following sequence -- =SPC f c=. This is also called as the copy-file command.
- To ‘/Save all/‘ open files the sequence is -- =SPC f S=
- To close the file use -- =SPC b d=
- To switch between open files within the same Spacemacs instance, use -- =SPC b n=

* Copy, Cut & Paste
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: copy-cut-paste
    :END:

- Copy current word from cusor -- =ESC yw=
- Copy current line -- =ESC yy=
- Paste before current line -- =ESC P=
- Paste after current line -- =ESC p=
- Cut current line -- =ESC dd=
- Cut current word from cursor -- =ESC dw=

* Undo & Redo
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: undo-redo
    :END:

- Press =ESC u= to undo changes done.
- Press =ESC Ctrl r= to redo the changes.

* Find & replace
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: find-replace
    :END:

- To enter search mode , just press -- =/= followed by the text to search.
- Press enter to  focus to the text occurrence in the buffer. =n= -- moves to next occurrence, =N= -- moves to previous occurrence.
- =Alt %= enters the search and replace mode.

  - Enter first string to be search
  - Followed by the string to be replaced with
  - Press =y= for each replacement
  - Press =!= for all replacements in one shot.
  - Press =q= to stop the replacement

- Goto line -- =SPC j l <line number>=

* Run command
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: run-command
    :END:

- Any windows shell command can be executed from within Spacemacs -- =SPC !=

* Bookmarks
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: bookmarks
    :END:

- Set bookmark with =SPC f b <bookmark-name>=
- Go to existing bookmark =SPC f b <bookmark-name>=. No need to enter complete bookmark name, as it filters the current list as the name is enterered.

* Browse
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: browse
    :END:

- =ESC 0= jump to the last character of the current line.
- =ESC $= jump to the first character of the current line.
- =ESC g= jump to the first character on the first line of the file.
- =ESC G= jump to the last character on the last line of the file.
