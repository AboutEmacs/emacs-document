Another week, another trick. For this week, I wanted to give you an overview of my organization with the =org-mode= to be in continuity with the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/98nkt6/tip_how_do_i_synchronize_my_org_files_with_my/][previous tip]].

*NOTE:* there's no code on this post, since I don't have anything magical to present. Also, I know that a lot of posts already exist about how to be organized with =org-mode=, but I figured one more wouldn't hurt 😊

First and foremost, you need to know why nowadays it is more important than before to be organized. Well, we live in a world where everything has to go fast while limiting stress and increasing our productivity. We can say that organization is the way we can be productive by saving time, while limiting our stress.

Personally, it's been 5 years since I started being organized with =org-mode= and I must admit that it was difficult because we quickly tend to give up when the organization is screwed up for some reason. I started by wanting to be organized because I noticed that the most successful people are organized. This organization is mainly done through time and money management.

Even if I am not always satisfied with the level I have to manage my organization, when I look at the person I was 5 years ago, I am pleased to have made efforts to improve it. Remember that your time is your most valuable asset.

That being said, it is important that you know yourself before you want to start an organization that you will not respect.

The questions you should ask yourself are the following:

1. How much sleep do I need to not feel tired?

2. Am I more of a morning or evening person?

3. How much time can I concentrate on a task?

4. Why would I want to improve my organization?

Once you have those answers, then you can organize your schedule around that.

For the setup of my organization in =org-mode=, here are the people on whom I take inspiration and that I suggest you:

- Sacha Chua;

- alphapapa;

- Nicolas Petton;

- John Wiegley.

In addition to that, I tend to follow [[https://www.youtube.com/user/electrickeye91][Thomas Frank]]'s advices like writing 3 evening tasks to do for the next day and tidying up our workspace every night so that it is already operational.

From a file structure point of view, here is what I use:

- *agenda*: includes all files related to =org-agenda=.

These files are as follows:

1. =calendar.org=: contains events related to special days. In short, this file contains =%%(org-calendar-holiday)= to display special event days and =%%(org-contacts-anniversaries)= to display my contacts' birthdays.

2. =contacts.org=: contains the details of my contacts ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/8toivy/tip_how_to_manage_your_contacts_with_orgcontacts/][read more on this subject]]). For the headers used, I use: Business, Family, Family Friends and Friends.

3. =organizer.org=: contains the entries from tasks that need to be refile. I try as much as possible that every week, this file is empty of tasks. For the headers used, I use: Tasks and When...

4. =people.org=: contains the entries from people-related tasks. For the headers used, I use: Family, Family Friends, Friends, Meetups, Tasks.

5. =review.org=: contains weekly and monthly reviews. My reviews mainly consist in rereading the daily entries of my journal and completing them with a report made by =org-clock-report= in order to note my productivity (e.g. by noting the time spent to study, personal projects, playing, watch series, etc.). *NOTE:* one of my desires, is to be able to draw a circle graph generated with =TikZ= in =LaTeX= which would take the column names present in the table and display in percentage the time spent on each task in order to have a visual aspect ([[http://www.texample.net/media/tikz/examples/PNG/pie-chart-color.png][something like shown here]]). If any of you have an idea to do that, I would be very interested 😊

6. =routine.org=: contains my daily tasks. For the headers used, I use: Every day, Once a week, Once a month, Once a quarter, Once a year and When...

7. =school.org=: contains the entries from school-related tasks. *NOTE:* this file is temporary, since I'm still a student. It will be replaced by =work.org= once I have a permanent work.

- *archives*: includes the task archives of my =org= files. I try to archive every week to avoid polluting my =org= files with finished tasks and that I no longer intend to pay attention to it.

The archiving structure I currently use is as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    - 2018
     - organizer.org_archive
     - people.org_archive
     - review.org_archive
     - school.org_archive
    ...
#+END_EXAMPLE

However, I would like to change to something more structured as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    - 2018
     - january
     - week1
     - organizer.org_archive
     - people.org_archive
     - review.org_archive
     - school.org_archive
     ...
     ...
    ...
#+END_EXAMPLE

- *courses*: includes =org= files related to my courses. I tend to create one large =org= file per course. The reason why I prefer to use =org= for my classes is that I write faster with a keyboard than with a pen.

- *journal:* includes =org= files related to =org-journal= ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/8kz8dv/tip_how_i_use_orgjournal_to_improve_my/][read more on this subject]]).

- *ledger:* includes =org= files related to =ledger= ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/8x4xtt/tip_how_i_use_ledger_to_track_my_money/][read more on this subject]]).

- *other:* includes =org= files that couldn't find their place in the other files (e.g. =books.org=, =learning.org=, etc.)

- *summaries:* includes =org= files which includes summaries on subjects I liked and problem solving (e.g. crypt external hard drive, root phone, etc.).

*NOTE:* recently, I'm using =git= to do control management with my =org= files. Which helps, if I do a misusing manipulation with my files.

​This tip was the last of 17 previously posted. I intend to pause the time with these posts until I update myself to be able to propose more content. I want to thank you for all your support, I hope that I was able to help you in one way or another because you helped me a lot with your advices. Feel free to give your tips in the comments about your organization 🐈

For the curious, you can find my config on [[https://github.com/rememberYou/.emacs.d][GitHub]].

I wish you a good evening or a good day, Emacs friend!
